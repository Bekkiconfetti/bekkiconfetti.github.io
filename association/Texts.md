EXPLORATION ON TEABAGS

It started in the first semester, when used teabags where starting to accumulate on my desk as a by- product from my work at the studio. I was fascinated by their color scheme and diverse shapes, so I started collecting and mounting them on the wall behind me.
I first exhibited them on a flat surface, showcasing the richness of the resulting texture and play of colors. In the next step I explored their potential in a more dynamic setting and staged them on the human body.

INEDIBLE FOODPORN

The algorithm is a particular gourmand. It will nibble the hardest of sprinkles, chew the dryest dough, lick the most toxic frosting - in short, it will devour everything it's offered under just one condition - it must look tasty. 
I made this photo series in spring 2021. It was the second lock-down and as I was consuming copious amounts of foodporn on Instagram, I started wondering whether anyone was actually eating all these beautiful pastries, decorative rolls, and colorful sponge-cakes.

TEXTILES & CODE

Textiles and code are two areas that have historically been closely intertwined, but today are often considered separately. This has much to do with persistent gender perceptions and the socially entrenched hierarchy of manual labor and technology. This project is an attempt to combine textile materials and electronic components, focusing not only on new approaches to human-technology interaction, but also on the potentials of bridging the two fields.
