        	      <p> It started in the first semester, when used teabags were starting to accumulate on my desk as a by-product from my work at the studio. I was fascinated by their color scheme and diverse shapes, so I started collecting and mounting them on the wall behind me. </p>
				        <p> I first exhibited them on a flat surface, showcasing the richness of the resulting texture and play of colors. In the next step I explored their potential in a more dynamic setting and staged them on the human body. </p>
