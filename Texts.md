EXPLORATION ON TEABAGS

It started in the first semester, when used teabags where starting to accumulate on my desk as a by- product from my work at the studio. I was fascinated by their color scheme and diverse shapes, so I started collecting and mounting them on the wall behind me.
I first exhibited them on a flat surface, showcasing the richness of the resulting texture and play of colors. In the next step I explored their potential in a more dynamic setting and staged them on the human body.

INEDIBLE FOODPORN

The algorithm is a particular gourmand. It will nibble the hardest of sprinkles, chew the dryest dough, lick the most toxic frosting - in short, it will devour everything it's offered under just one condition - it must look tasty. 
I made this photo series in spring 2021. It was the second lock-down and as I was consuming copious amounts of foodporn on Instagram, I started wondering whether anyone was actually eating all these beautiful pastries, decorative rolls, and colorful sponge-cakes.

TEXTILES & CODE

Textiles and code are two areas that have historically been closely intertwined, but today are often considered separately. This has much to do with persistent gender perceptions and the socially entrenched hierarchy of manual labor and technology. This project is an attempt to combine textile materials and electronic components, focusing not only on new approaches to human-technology interaction, but also on the potentials of bridging the two fields.

BIO TEXT

Hi!

I'm Rebekka and I'm a designer based in Germany and the Netherlands.
I was born in Cologne and grew up in Germany and Slovakia. After a short period of studying Maths and Mechanical Engineering in Regensburg, I switched to Product Design at the Hochschule Wismar. This is where my curiosity in feminist approaches to technology started to form. After graduating, I decided to follow up on these interests at the Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands. 

Currently still based there, I'm now developing my own practice. If you'd like to know more about me and my work, send me an email and I'll forward you my full CV and Portfolio!

###### The Cat in the Black Box

A panel discussion exploring perspectives on data and design, featuring visuals triggered by a speech recognition algorithm listening in on the conversation, and an interactive black box.

Technology is becoming so complex nowadays that there is a need to unpack the metaphor and design of this black box. Following the digital appearance of the cat (as a meme, as a physical body, as a metaphor) this panel aims to demystify the black box. By doing so it will highlight the different angles from which data can be used to relate to, read and impact a cat.



Panelists:  Jan Christian Schulz , Lukas Völp , Marie Verdeil, Teresa Fernández Pello & Rebekka Jochem

Specialist: Ron Wakkary
