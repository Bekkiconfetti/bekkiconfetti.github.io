              <h3>Repost </h3>
              <p>This new take on parcels invites recipients to return the packaging into the postal cycle so the same box can be used to transport orders to new customers again and again. When empty, reinforcing sheets can be taken out, folded, and laid flat into the box, resulting in minimal dead volume.  </p>
              <p>  The boxes are purposefully designed to create engagement. For each of the about 30 tours the packaging embarks on, there is a space on the back where participating retailers place a sticker to indicate the destination. This means that everyone can retrace the travels of the individual packaging they are holding, making it unique and more collectible on every leg of the journey. Inspired by these unique odysseys, the graphics on the parcel were created by generating potential routes through European capitals using a javascript-based code in Processing. </p>
              <p> Developed in collaboration with Jacobo Cuesta Wolf. </p>

        	 				<h3>Teabags </h3>

        	      	<p> It started in the first semester, when used teabags were starting to accumulate on my desk as a by-product from my work at the studio. I was fascinated by their color scheme and diverse shapes, so I started collecting and mounting them on the wall behind me. </p>
				        	<p> I first exhibited them on a flat surface, showcasing the richness of the resulting texture and play of colors. In the next step I explored their potential in a more dynamic setting and staged them on the human body. </p>

            	<p>The algorithm is a particular gourmand. It will nibble the hardest of sprinkles, chew the dryest dough, lick the most toxic frosting - in short, it will devour everything it's offered under just one condition - it must look tasty. </p>
							<p> I made this photo series in spring 2021. It was the second lock-down and as I was consuming copious amounts of foodporn on Instagram, I started wondering whether anyone was actually eating all these beautiful pastries, decorative rolls, and colorful sponge-cakes. </p>

          		<h3>Breaking the Code </h3>
							<p>Textiles and code are two areas that have historically been closely intertwined, but today are often considered separately. This has much to do with persistent gender perceptions and the socially entrenched hierarchy of manual labor and technology. This project is an attempt to combine textile materials and electronic components, focusing not only on new approaches to human-technology interaction, but also on the potentials of bridging the two fields.</p>

       <h3>Bulling </h3>
       <p>A speculative matchmaking platform for bovine breeding, developed in collaboration with Kathleen Berthus and Niels Postma.</p>
       <p>The modern dairy industry in the Netherlands is centered around fully automated stables where the cowsâ€™ health and reproductive cycles are closely monitored. This data is used to optimize the herd, informing a highly digitalized and data-driven breeding process.</p>
       <p>Currently, dairy farmers purchase bull semen to inseminate their cows from online databases, making a selection based on standardized criteria.  While a compatibility algorithm recommending matches might actually simplify this process, the promise of sparks flying when two compatible data sets are found reveals the extreme abstraction that defines the mating ritual of contemporary cows.</p>
